# Web Basics

This project is my first Web Site without using CSS and HTML


## Notes

Also I have to learn how to write a md file with images and links so here you can see [How to do it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14494747/add-images-to-readme-md-on-github) :+1:.

[Also here (Basic Writing)](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#using-emoji)

I think that StackOverflow and Google is too important because all info is there :blush:.

So If you want to know how to put emojis just put `:EMOJICODE:`. You can find emojis code [here](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/) :relaxed:.
